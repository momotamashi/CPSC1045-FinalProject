- added canvas + functions for background, character (green box), and obstacle (red box)

- added obstacle movement onclick Start button

- added Start/Stop buttons for obstacle movement at the moment, right now the obstacle can move across the page but i don't have it regenerating again + if you click SPACE or Start
button again, the timer speeds up
